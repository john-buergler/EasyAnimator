Changes to the code for this Extra Credit assignment:

There was an addition to the shape pool, now including a plus shape that can do the same
functions as the other shapes.

There was also an outline mode addition, this adds more functionality, allowing the user to switch
their shapes to an outline mode instead of filled. This option can be selected in the interactive
view during the animation.

Along with these changes, we added a button that can switch the animation to play in discrete mode,
only showing the frames during which a movement begins. This button can be seen in the interactive
panel and it acts like a toggle.

Finally, we added a slo-mo feature, where you can designate certain times at which you want the
speed of the animation to change. This is done by adding another line to your input file with this
format:

tempo speed 10 start 150 end 180

for example.
